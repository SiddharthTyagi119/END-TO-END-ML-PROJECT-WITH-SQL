pip install dvc
dvc init
 
To untrack any track data by git - just delete the data 
git add .
git commit

To track any untrack data by dvc - dvc add artifacts/raw.csv
raw.csv.dvc will have the hash value of original data. And with the same hash it will have a tracked data under .dvc folder.


Note ----
.dvc- all the tracking will be done under this folder
track dvc config , dvcignore and gitignore by git and we only track the data only by dvc
we will track raw.csv.dvc and .gitignore present under artifacts directory data file with git.

git add artifacts/raw.csv.dvc and git add artifacts/.gitignore

When you change your main raw data, then your hash value in raw.csv.dvc also change. And you can find the tracked data under .dvc folder.

#Track the data with dvc and its configurations files with git.
